## About

**Not My Typo** is a from-scratch clone of the [monkeytype.com](monkeytype.com) typing-test
experience: words stream across the screen, you type them, and the app tracks your words-per-minute,
accuracy, consistency, and misses.

It was built as a practice/learning project first, with an deep customization layer bolted
on second: themes, fonts, radius, caret style, keystroke sounds, and stat display are all first-class,
user-facing settings rather than an afterthought.

There is no account system, no backend, and no leaderboard. Everything runs client-side and persists
to `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Four test modes**: fixed word count (30/60/90), timed (15s/30s/60s), zen (untimed, infinite), and
  quotes;
- **Live and final stats that can never disagree**: raw and correct-only WPM, accuracy, consistency, and miss count are computed by the same
  pure functions for both the running HUD and the results screen;
- **Six languages**: English, Portuguese (Brazil), French, Spanish, German, and Italian. Word lists
  are fetched live from a [free word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) and instantly fall back to bundled local word lists if that
  API is slow or unreachable, so a test never stalls or breaks mid-run;
- **Word rarity filter**: an optional difficulty dial (from very common to
  intentionally rare words);
- **Config-driven customization**: 14 color palettes, 11 font families (mono, sans, and serif),
  4 corner-radius presets, light/dark/system theme, 3 caret styles, and a mechanical-keyboard-style
  keystroke sound pack with adjustable volume.
